This is a simplistic web application that is capable of tracking books in a library format and various information regarding the pieces of text. The information is stored locally and has yet to be tranfered to a server side storage. Once I learn more back-end programming and set up a framework to integrate that into the web application it will be released. This is another of my educational projects that are helping me learn front end programming and web development.
